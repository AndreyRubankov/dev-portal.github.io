## Discovery API Slack bot

Back in June, we held our mini-hackathon event, aka devjam, in Los Angeles, to a sold out audience. 
One of the key topics on the event was bot creation with Ticketmaster Open platform.

[TMbot](https://degratnik.github.io/tmbot/) is the first bot for Slack that allows discovering Ticketmaster events.
You can add it to your channel and anyone in your channel can communicate with the bot.

The bot can find events by keyword, location or date. If you are a Slack fan the TMbot is a perfect way to find entertainment with Ticketmaster without leaving your favorite messenger.

The bot based on Discovery API and developed with Botkit library on Node.Js and hosted on Heroku. The application is under development, so you are welcome to [join](https://github.com/degratnik/tmbot).
