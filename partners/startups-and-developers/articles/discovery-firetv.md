## Amazon Fire TV

This is a very useful [open-source](https://github.com/gorgeorg/FireTV_POC) application that helps to browse events using Ticketmasterâ€™s API. Users can find events according to their predefined location (ZIP Code) on Amazon Fire TV.

The events list appears after searching by keywords and it is split into categories. Detailed event info is shown after choosing one item and user can buy a ticket using QR-code and look at the venue on a map.
