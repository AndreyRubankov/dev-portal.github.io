Hackpoly is back and ready to hack into the future! This year we are going back to the crazy ideas and focus on making this the most productive 24 hours ever!

From February 6-7 at the Bronco Student Center, we invite everyone of all skill levels to come out to our annual 24-hour hackathon and create whatever you can imagine!
